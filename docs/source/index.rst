======================
Multipolynomial Bases.
======================

This is module implementing bases of multipolynomial in Sage.

To use this module, you need to import it:: 

    from multipolynomial_bases import *

This documentation is still a **work in progress**: it might be incomplete and even
outdated as the progam has been going though many refactorization since its original
implementation (but has never been properly finished...). Nevertheless, all given examples
have been doctested and work.
